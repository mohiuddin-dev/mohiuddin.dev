Hi, Welcome To My Site.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

About me !! <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

  <p class="intro">I'm <strong>Mohiuddin</strong>, a <strong>Big Data Architect</strong> with over <strong>15 years</strong> of experience transforming data into scalable solutions for Fortune 100 companies. My work sits at the intersection of <strong>data engineering, cloud computing, and analytics</strong>, where I design systems that turn complexity into clarity.</p>

  <p>My journey began at <strong>16</strong> when I bought my first computer - sparking a lifelong passion for technology. That curiosity led me to study <strong>Public Health Information Systems</strong> at Sweden's <strong>Karolinska Institute</strong> (with a focus on quantitative analysis) and later earn a <strong>Master's in Computer Science</strong>, specializing in <strong>Cloud Computing Architecture</strong>, from the <strong>University of Maryland</strong>.</p>

  <p>When I'm not architecting data platforms, I'm exploring new tech, mentoring, or collaborating on innovative projects. <span class="highlight">Let's build something meaningful together.</span></p>
